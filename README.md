## What is Scrivener?

Scrivener is a sophisticated application that provides a comprehensive set of tools for writers and researchers to manage complex writing projects. Instead of forcing you to work with a single, long document, it allows you to break your text into manageable sections and rearrange them with ease using its intuitive corkboard and outliner features. This approach makes it ideal for crafting large manuscripts, detailed reports, and structured scripts.

This powerful writing software acts as a project management hub, enabling you to store all your research—including web pages, images, PDFs, and video files—directly inside your project. You can view your research side-by-side with your writing, ensuring all necessary information is at your fingertips without switching between multiple applications. The full-screen composition mode helps eliminate distractions, allowing you to concentrate solely on getting words onto the page.

Whether you are drafting a novel, compiling a PhD thesis, or writing a complex legal brief, Scrivener offers the flexibility and power to organize your thoughts and structure your work effectively. Its compilation feature provides unparalleled control over the final formatting of your document, allowing you to export to a wide range of formats suitable for publishers, printers, or eBook readers.
